// is a dropdown a specific type of thing or can it be a list mapped to a component of any kind and the
// only thing it needs to make it a dropdown is the mechanics of it? If it can be anything then the
// only a component to edit, delete and select items is needed for anytime skills are listed (in froms
// or on the add skill page) and possible can be used anytime anything is listed. This could also have
// an option for including headers or not.

// If used as dropdown list, this component must take a param to filer list by as seaches may need to be
// done outside the scope of this component and passed in.

// Should item list be seperate from table with headers or the same component. Could have item list used
// by tables and dropdown search.

// would need to take params of everything required to get api and type.

// how much storage is a dictonary for english
// and for js/ts/node/etc.
